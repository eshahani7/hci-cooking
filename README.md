### Nav Instructions
1. Include stylesheet under css/nav-styles.css.
2. Include script under js/nav.js AND jquery minified CDN (see home.html)
3. Place content under <!-- NAV AND HEADER --> at top of page body. Replace title with your own.
Note: not functional or complete yet... can someone make the profile look the way it looks on the designs?
